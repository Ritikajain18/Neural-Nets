    "1. You had previously shut down some neurons during forward propagation, by applying a mask $D^{[1]}$ to `A1`. In backpropagation, you will have to shut down the same neurons, by reapplying the same mask $D^{[1]}$ to `dA1`. \n",
    "2. During forward propagation, you had divided `A1` by `keep_prob`. In backpropagation, you'll therefore have to divide `dA1` by `keep_prob` again (the calculus interpretation is that if $A^{[1]}$ is scaled by `keep_prob`, then its derivative $dA^{[1]}$ is also scaled by the same `keep_prob`).\n"
